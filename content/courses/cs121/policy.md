## Course Schedule
The most up-to-date course schedule will be posted on course website schedule page: https://peilong.github.io/courses/cs121/schedule/. Students are responsible for checking the schedule regularly. Schedule page will include: 1) teaching topics for each meeting; 2) reading assignments for each day and 3) reminders on specific days.

## Course Announcements & Discussion

All course announcements will be sent to your Etown email accounts via Canvas Announcements. You are responsible for signing up for this service and checking your emails regularly.

Every student should have received my invitation to join our team "CS121-FA2021" on Microsoft Teams. Discussions are encouraged to be posted on the "QA" channel of the team. Private instant messages can be sent directly to your recipient, e.g. the instructor.

## Attendance Policies

Attendance is expected of every student at every lecture. Students are responsible for all content covered in class as well as assigned book chapters. Due to their nature, pop quizzes cannot be made up.

Except in the case of documented emergencies, neither exams nor in-class labs can be made up afterwards.  For excused absences, students must arrange to take the exam or do the lab before the normally scheduled time.  Arrangements must be made with the instructor at least two weeks prior to the scheduled time.

Students are expected to maintain an attitude of respect at all times toward their colleagues, the equipment, and the instructor. Students are expected to refrain from using the computers for non-course related purposes during class time and will be penalized 1% of the final grade for each occurrence. Cell phones and similar devices should be turned off before entering the classroom. Students who use offensive language, misuse computing facilities, or are otherwise disruptive of the classroom will be asked to leave.

## Statement on School Closure

In the event that classes do not meet because Elizabethtown College is closed or delayed due to inclement weather or some other emergency, the slides that would have been covered during the missed classes will posted through Piazza group.  Students are expected to do the assigned reading, review the slides, and e-mail the instructor with any questions.  There will also be an opportunity to ask questions about the material when classes resume.

If a scheduled exam or lab is missed, it will normally be made up on the day that classes resume.  If the College is closed on a day when a project is due, the project due date will also normally be extended until the day when classes resume.  If circumstances render either of these makeup policies unreasonable, the instructor will send an e-mail explaining an alternative makeup opportunity to each student’s Elizabethtown e-mail account.

## Statement on Plagiarism

Please refer to the Student Handbook for the college’s policy.  All projects and assignments must be completed by students individually, without assistance from anyone other than the instructor.  Students can discuss the course material with each other at a conceptual level, but each student must do his or her own work.  For projects, exams, and all other activities in the course, students are expected to act according to the official policy on academic dishonesty and the highest standards of personal integrity.

The first infraction of academic honesty in this course will carry a penalty of a 0 for the project, lab, or exam in question and a reduction of a full letter grade in the final grade.  If a second infraction occurs, the students involved will fail the course, and the instructor will seek the maximum penalty possible under the college’s regulations, up to and including expulsion.

## Statement on Disability

Full statement can be found at [link](https://elizabethtown-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/ouimetc_etown_edu/EfZ-QooKt_VPjgwsWJz230wB3Rb6CIHsPvE0xuqWCpr-UA?e=4%3acZzjpW&at=9). Elizabethtown College welcomes otherwise qualified students with disabilities to participate in all of its courses, programs, services, and activities. If you have a documented disability and would like to request accommodations in order to access course material, activities, or requirements, please contact the Director of Disability Services, Lynne Davies, by phone (361-1227) or e-mail daviesl@etown.edu. If your documentation meets the college’s documentation guidelines, you will be given a letter from Disability Services for each of your professors.  Students experiencing certain documented temporary conditions, such as post-concussive symptoms, may also qualify for temporary academic accommodations and adjustments. As early as possible in the semester, set up an appointment to meet with the instructor to discuss the academic adjustments specified in your accommodations letter as they pertain to my class.

## COVID-related Expectations

All students are expected to adhere to the established community expectations around safety, including: daily digital health reporting, physical distancing, proper wearing of facial coverings within buildings and classrooms and when within six feet of individuals outdoors, frequent handwashing, and participation in cleaning and sanitizing protocols as requested. You will be turned away from class if you do not have a face covering. Students diagnosed with a health condition that precludes mask wearing can contact Lynne Davies in Disability Services (daviesl@etown.edu) to request remote learning as a reasonable accommodation.

If you are exhibiting any symptoms of COVID or fail to pass the daily health screen, do not come to class.
Failure to adhere to the established community expectations around safety will result in notification of Campus Security and application of the student conduct process for failure to comply, endangering the well-being of others, and/or disorderly conduct. The student code of conduct applies also to participation in all virtual activities, including Zoom sessions and discussion boards


## Statement on Religious Observances

The College is eager to facilitate individual religious beliefs and practices whenever possible while retaining course student learning outcomes. It is your responsibility to meet with the class instructor in advance to request arrangements related to your religious observances that may conflict with this class, and to make appropriate plans to make up any missed work.
