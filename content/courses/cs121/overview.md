## Course Coverage

The fundamental concepts of computer organization, machine-level representation of data, algorithmic development and structured programming are presented with an emphasis on the syntactic and execution characteristics of the Java programming language, including data types; arithmetic operators and assignment; input/output, selection and iteration constructs; procedural abstraction; arrays; object-oriented programming and class design; and library usage.


## Student Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

* Apply knowledge of computing and mathematics, including common data structures and basic algorithms, to solve problems
* Design, implement, and evaluate a computer-based system, process, component or program to meet desired needs
* Describe fundamental principles of the cycle of designing, implementing, compiling, and testing code
* Learn to adhere to standards of style and documentation
* Develop an understanding of data types and basic operations in an object-oriented programming language
* Give examples of contributions of mathematics and computer science to the modern world
* Use inductive or deductive reasoning to formulate solutions to problems
* Model real-world phenomena mathematically and computationally
* Manipulate strings, use basic I/O constructs
* Apply Boolean algebra, selection statements, loop statements and arrays to problem solving
* Use procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms
