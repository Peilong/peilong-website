## Course Coverage

Explore the foundational principles of computer organization, data representation, algorithmic development, and structured programming. Emphasizing Python's syntactic and execution traits, delve into data types, arithmetic operations, input/output mechanisms, selection and iteration constructs. Discover procedural abstraction, arrays, object-oriented programming, class design, and harness Python's power for Data Science.


## Student Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

* Apply fundamental computing and mathematical knowledge, including data structures and basic algorithms, to effectively solve problems using Python.
* Design, implement, and evaluate computer-based systems, processes, components, or programs to fulfill specific requirements.
* Describe and apply the core principles of the software development cycle in the context of Python programming.
* Demonstrate proficiency in adhering to coding standards, style guidelines, and documentation practices.
* Develop a solid understanding of data types and object-oriented programming concepts.
* Utilize Python for Data Science, including data manipulation, analysis, and visualization, to gain insights from real-world datasets.
* Apply Python programming constructs like strings manipulation, basic I/O operations, Boolean algebra, selection statements, loop statements, and arrays to effectively solve computational challenges using both procedural and object-oriented paradigms.
