## Grading Weights

The final grade for this course depends upon the grades and scores earned on course components weighted as follows:

*	**5%**: X in-class pop quizzes.
*	**20%**: Bi-daily reading and coding homework.
*	**20%**: 5 team projects.
* **15%**: 6 in-class labs (drop the lowest grade).
*	**15%**: 2 lab tests.
*	**10%**: 1 midterm exam.
*	**15%**: 1 final exam.

Grades will be computed by rounding numerical percentages to the nearest integer and applying the following table:

| Letter| Range| Letter | Range | Letter | Range|
|----|--------|----|-------|----|-------|
| A  | 93-100 | B- | 80-82 | D+ | 67-69 |
| A- | 90-92  | C+ | 77-79 | D  | 63-66 |
| B+ | 87-89  | C  | 73-76 | D- | 60-62 |
| B  | 83-86  | C- | 70-72 | F  | 0-59  |

```Grades for each project, lab, quiz, and exam will be recorded in Canvas (https://etown.instructure.com/).  
```

## Bi-daily Reading Homework

All reading and coding homework assignments have to be completed individually in this course. All the bi-daily homework will be released at the beginning of the semester. Each homework is due by 9:30 AM on the class day. For example, "Reading Week 2-2" is due by 9:30 AM on Wednesday of week 2. Students are welcome to finish the assignments ahead of the scheduled deadline, but **no late submission is allowed**.

## In-class Labs

All labs are to be done individually, in class, with the assistance of the instructor and TAs. 
Each assignment will be given near the beginning of a class and must be completed before the due time. Some of the labs allow for late submission till midnight with late penalty, but no submission is allowed beyond the lab day. To receive full credits, a programming assignment must pass all given test cases, but partial credits will be awarded based on the understanding of the material demonstrated by the student’s code.

## Team Projects

All projects are team projects in this course. For each project, students must form a team of 2 members. Teams are responsible for dividing their workload and meeting offline for at least 2 times for each project. Documented meeting agenda and minutes have to be submitted as part of the deliverable. Students should select their teams by using the Groups tab under People, on the Canvas webpage.

Teams are responsible for dividing their workload. Except under extreme circumstances, all members of the team will receive the same grade for each project. One member of each team is designated the leader. The files for each project should be zipped up and uploaded by the team leader using Canvas before the due date. Projects must not be stored in a public folder. All project submissions must follow the provided file name requirements or risk a score of 0. **If the project does not compile, the student will receive a score of 0.**

Projects will be graded based on the following criteria:

* Correctness: Finding the right answer
* Formatting:	Displaying the right answer according to instructions
* Style and Documentation: Producing readable code with appropriate comments

Only project is allowed to submit late. Late submissions will lose ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdpi%7B150%7D%20%5Cfn_phv%20%5Clarge%202%5E%7B%28n-1%29%7D) points per day, including weekends and holidays. For example, -1 after 1 day, -2 after 2 days, -4 after 3 days … until 8+ days students will receive 0 score.  Under no circumstances should any student disclose their code, or copy the code written by other students or from an outside source. Both students will receive 0 score on the disclosed/copied assignment.
