## Anaconda Distribution

In this course the only software you will need to install and play with is the Anaconda Distribution. It is a popular data science platform that consists of almost all the packages you will ever need in Python and R. Find the download link for your system from here: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/. You must download the Python 3.x version.

**Note:**

Anaconda Distribution is available on the computers in the Esbenshade 281, Hoover 108 and Nicarry 208 computer laboratories and in the Computer Science commons area (E284).

## Google Colab

Google Colab ([link](https://colab.research.google.com/)) is a cloud-based Jupyter notebook-like service that is free for use under certain usage quota. It is required that students learn to use this service for speeding up the training time for Deep Learning models.
