## Anaconda Distribution

In this course the only software you will need to install and play with is the Anaconda Distribution. It is a popular data science platform that consists of almost all the packages you will ever need in Python and R. Find the download link for your system from here: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/. You must download the Python 3.x version.

**Note:**

Anaconda Distribution is available on the computers in the Esbenshade 281, Hoover 108 and Nicarry 208 computer laboratories and in the Computer Science commons area (E284).

## Jupyter Notebook (included in Anaconda)

A Jupyter Notebook server is hosted at: http://cs64.etown.edu:8000. Note that you need to VPN into campus network if visiting from off campus. If you are a member of the class, your default user name on the server is: your last name followed by first name initial, e.g. Taylor Swift's account is "swiftt", and the default login password is "pass". Reset your password immediately after login.

## Other software

Will be introduced as the course goes.
