## Course Coverage

This project-based hands-on course covers various data processing techniques in the data mining pipeline such as 1) data extraction from large data warehouses, 2) data preprocessing to obtain data features, 3) data modeling and data training, and 4) knowledge generation. A number of well-defined data mining tasks such as classification, prediction, association, clustering, dimensionality reduction and deep learning are thoroughly discussed. Design and implementation issues for the aforementioned tasks are also addressed.


## Student Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, the successful students will be able to:

*	(Scope) Understand the background and application scope of data mining.
* (Data) Extract raw data from SQL databases using data science toolkit.
*	(Hacking) Proficiently use the Python data science toolset including Jupyter notebook, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn and Tensorflow etc. to address data mining tasks.
* (Modeling) Apply data analytical models including regression, clustering and neural network to solve data science problems.
*	(Knowledge) Obtain knowledge from the data with the various models.
