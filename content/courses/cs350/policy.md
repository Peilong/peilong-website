## Course Schedule
The most up-to-date course schedule will be posted on course website schedule page: https://peilong.github.io/courses/cs350/schedule/. Students are responsible for checking the schedule regularly. Schedule page will include: 1) teaching topics for each meeting; 2) reading assignments for each week and 3) special notes on specific days.

## Course Announcements & Discussion

All course announcements will be sent to your E-Town email accounts via Canvas Announcements. You are responsible for signing up for this service and checking your emails regularly.

I have created a Microsoft Teams channel ([link](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3aa8cdd959c2e249a989d401e20fc95524%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=81ffa3c7-aa45-454a-b495-7f43c78e5024&tenantId=1d884f12-a0d7-42f0-8b15-3a91c853bcb5)) to facilitate course related discussion.  Discussions are encouraged to be posted on the "QA" channel from Teams. Private instant messages can be sent directly to your recipient by search your recipient's name on the "search" bar.

## Attendance Policies

Attendance is expected of every student at every lecture. Students are responsible for all content covered in class as well as assigned book chapters. Due to their nature, pop quizzes cannot be made up.

Except in the case of documented emergencies, neither exams nor in-class labs can be made up afterwards.  For excused absences, students must arrange to take the exam or do the lab before the normally scheduled time.  Arrangements must be made with the instructor at least two weeks prior to the scheduled time.

Students are expected to maintain an attitude of respect at all times toward their colleagues, the equipment, and the instructor.  Cell phones and similar devices is prohibited from using during lecturing time.  Students who use offensive language, misuse computing facilities, or are otherwise disruptive of the classroom will be asked to leave.


## Statement on School Closure

In the event that classes do not meet because Elizabethtown College is closed or delayed due to inclement weather or some other emergency, the slides that would have been covered during the missed classes will be posted through Canvas.  Students are expected to do the assigned reading, review the slides, and e-mail the instructor with any questions. There will also be an opportunity to ask questions about the material when classes resume.

If a scheduled exam or lab is missed, it will normally be made up on the day that classes resume.  If the College is closed on a day when a project is due, the project due date will also normally be extended until the day when classes resume.  If circumstances render either of these makeup policies unreasonable, the instructor will send an e-mail explaining an alternative makeup opportunity to each studentâ€™s Elizabethtown e-mail account.

## Statement on Academic Hishonesty

## Statement on the Use of ChatGPT and Generative AI Tools

The use of GenAI tools like ChatGPT to generate source code is prohibited for your assignments in this course unless otherwise noted in the syllabus. Therefore, your instructor will consider it a violation of academic integrity to use a GenAI tool for any purpose that is not explicitly outlined in assignment instructions. While this new technology can be very useful in certain contexts, it is important to make sure that its usage in the classroom setting is limited in order to ensure that you are doing original work and developing your critical thinking skills. In circumstances in which AI usage is permitted in class, you must acknowledge that usage and provide the chatbot with credit when it is a cited source. For instance, to cite ChatGPT in APA, the APA provides some direction at https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/how-to-cite-chatgpt. If you have any questions or uncertainty over the use of AI in this course, please reach out to the instructor. 

## Statement on Disability, Religious Observances, and COVID-Related Expectations

## International Student Accommodation

In recognition of the diverse linguistic backgrounds of our international students, we offer several accommodations to ensure a fair and supportive learning environment.

+ Exams: If you encounter unfamiliar terms not covered in class, the Testing Center proctors are authorized to assist with translations. This support aims to clarify the meaning without providing an advantage.
+ Oral Presentations: International students, along with those who have auditory processing challenges, may request extended time for presentations. You are also permitted to use written notes to aid your delivery. Time adjustments will be made on a case-by-case basis to ensure you can effectively convey your knowledge while staying within reasonable limits.
  
If you require these or other accommodations, please communicate your needs in advance so appropriate arrangements can be made.
 
## Diversity and Inclusivity Statement

I consider this classroom to be a place where you will be treated with respect, and I welcome individuals of all ages, backgrounds, beliefs, ethnicities, genders, gender identities, gender expressions, national origins, religious affiliations, sexual orientations, ability - and other visible and non-visible differences. All members of this class are expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming and inclusive environment for every other member of the class.
