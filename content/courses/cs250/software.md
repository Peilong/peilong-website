## Anaconda Individual Edition

In this course, the only software you'll need to install is the Anaconda Individual Edition. Anaconda is a widely-used data science platform that includes nearly all the packages you'll need for Python and R. Please download the Python 3.10+ version from the following link, choosing the installer that matches your operating system: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual.

**Note:**

Anaconda is also available on the computers in the Esbenshade 281, Hoover 108 and Nicarry 208 computer laboratories and in the Computer Science commons area (E284).
