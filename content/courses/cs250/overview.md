## Course Coverage

This hands-on, project-based course introduces data science, blending computer science and statistics to extract insights from diverse datasets. Students master Python's data science tools, including Jupyter, NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, and apply advanced visualization techniques. The curriculum emphasizes statistical understanding and analytical models like regression and clustering. A key focus is on data storytelling, enabling students to effectively communicate complex insights, bridging technical analysis with strategic decision-making.


## Student Learning Outcomes
