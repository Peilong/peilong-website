## Course Coverage

This hands-on computer security course provides students with practical experience in software, web, system security, and cryptography. Participants will gain essential cybersecurity skills, learning to identify, analyze, and mitigate security vulnerabilities. Through guided labs and projects, students will apply secure coding practices and ethical hacking techniques. The course emphasizes problem-solving, teamwork, and understanding cybersecurity concepts and terminologies. Upon completion, successful students will be well-prepared to address real-world cybersecurity challenges and pursue careers in the dynamic field of computer security.

## Student Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

* Apply knowledge of computing and mathematics appropriate to the discipline, including common data structures, basic algorithms, and modular arithmetic;
* Design, implement, and evaluate security policies and mechanisms to enforce those policies;
* Discuss the central issues of computer security: confidentiality, integrity, and availability;
* Design protocols and systems to minimize security vulnerabilities;
* Analyze current threats and how to minimize the associated risks in the areas of: computer security, OS security, web security, and cryptography;
* Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of various public and private key encryption techniques;
* Explain the usefulness of cryptographic hash functions;
* Communicate effectively with a broad range of audiences, and function effectively on teams using software engineering principles to accomplish a
common goal.
