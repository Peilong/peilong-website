This course introduces the student to the fundamentals of computer security. Foundational concepts such as confidentiality, integrity, and availability are discussed in the context of both designing systems and evaluating existing systems for vulnerabilities. Cryptography is explored as a tool that can be applied to many aspects of computer security. Theoretical discussions of security principles are enriched by examples from real world systems and protocols.
