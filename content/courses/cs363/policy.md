## COVID-related Expectations

I recognize that students may need to miss classes due to personal health reasons or for community measures necessary to promote public health. I have already prepared to substitute a reasonable educational experience aligned with that day’s learning objectives for students who miss class due to illness or quarantine.

+ In most cases, this will be downloading the gap notes and watching a recording of last year’s hyflex delivery of that same content. Ask me for the lecture recordings.
+ If you miss a coaching day, the homework is posted on Canvas and you can use my [Calendly link](https://calendly.com/dr_li/) to sign up for a time during office hours to Zoom with any questions.
+ Assessments must be taken in person due to academic integrity concerns. However, there are many opportunities to test and if we need a make-up day near the end of the semester, I will offer one.
+ Assignments are posted far in advance and, in most cases, will not be adjusted for mild illness.


## Course Schedule
The most up-to-date course schedule will be posted on course website schedule page: https://peilong.github.io/courses/cs363/schedule/. Students are responsible for checking the schedule regularly. Schedule page will include: 1) teaching topics for each meeting; 2) reading assignments for each week and 3) special notes on specific days.

## Course Announcements & Discussion

All course announcements will be sent to your E-Town email accounts via Canvas Announcements. You are responsible for signing up for this service and checking your emails regularly.

I have created a Microsoft Teams channel ([link](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3aa8cdd959c2e249a989d401e20fc95524%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=81ffa3c7-aa45-454a-b495-7f43c78e5024&tenantId=1d884f12-a0d7-42f0-8b15-3a91c853bcb5)) to facilitate course related discussion.  Discussions are encouraged to be posted on the "QA" channel from Teams. Private instant messages can be sent directly to your recipient by search your recipient's name on the "search" bar.

## Attendance Policies

Attendance is expected of every student at every lecture. Students are responsible for all content covered in class as well as assigned book chapters. Due to their nature, pop quizzes cannot be made up.

Except in the case of documented emergencies, neither exams nor in-class labs can be made up afterwards.  For excused absences, students must arrange to take the exam or do the lab before the normally scheduled time.  Arrangements must be made with the instructor at least two weeks prior to the scheduled time.

Students are expected to maintain an attitude of respect at all times toward their colleagues, the equipment, and the instructor.  Cell phones and similar devices is prohibited from using during lecturing time.  Students who use offensive language, misuse computing facilities, or are otherwise disruptive of the classroom will be asked to leave.


## Statement on School Closure

In the event that classes do not meet because Elizabethtown College is closed or delayed due to inclement weather or some other emergency, the slides that would have been covered during the missed classes will be posted through Canvas.  Students are expected to do the assigned reading, review the slides, and e-mail the instructor with any questions. There will also be an opportunity to ask questions about the material when classes resume.

If a scheduled exam or lab is missed, it will normally be made up on the day that classes resume.  If the College is closed on a day when a project is due, the project due date will also normally be extended until the day when classes resume.  If circumstances render either of these makeup policies unreasonable, the instructor will send an e-mail explaining an alternative makeup opportunity to each student’s Elizabethtown e-mail account.

## Diversity and Inclusivity Statement

I consider this classroom to be a place where you will be treated with respect, and I welcome individuals of all ages, backgrounds, beliefs, ethnicities, genders, gender identities, gender expressions, national origins, religious affiliations, sexual orientations, ability - and other visible and non-visible differences. All members of this class are expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming and inclusive environment for every other member of the class.
