A broad introduction to the discipline of computer science is given with a focus on its deep concepts and powerful impact. An emphasis is placed on seven “big ideas” developed by the CS Principles initiative (https://csforallteachers.org/computer-science-principles): creativity, abstraction, data, algorithms, programming, the Internet, and impact. Introductory skills in computer programming using Python is demonstrated with an emphasis on both the principles and practice of computer programming.


## Student Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, successful students will be able to:

* Describe and apply major scientific concepts of computing,
* Analyze and interpret data with the aid of computers,
* Explain the local and global impact of computing and the associated professional, ethical, legal, security and social responsibilities,
* Model real-world phenomena mathematically and computationally,
* Use basic tools of programming to solve problems.
