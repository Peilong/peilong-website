## Course Schedule
The most up-to-date course schedule will be posted on course website schedule page: https://peilong.github.io/courses/ds400/schedule/. Students are responsible for checking the schedule regularly. Schedule page will include: 1) teaching topics for each meeting; 2) reading assignments for each week and 3) special notes on specific days.

## Course Announcements & Discussion

All course announcements will be sent to your E-Town email accounts via Canvas Announcements. You are responsible for signing up for this service and checking your emails regularly.

I have created a Microsoft Teams channel ([link](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3aa8cdd959c2e249a989d401e20fc95524%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=81ffa3c7-aa45-454a-b495-7f43c78e5024&tenantId=1d884f12-a0d7-42f0-8b15-3a91c853bcb5)) to facilitate course related discussion.  Discussions are encouraged to be posted on the "QA" channel from Teams. Private instant messages can be sent directly to your recipient by search your recipient's name on the "search" bar.

## Attendance Policies

Attendance is expected of every student at every meeting. Students should come to meetings prepared to explain their progress and discuss appropriate technical issues.

## Statement on School Closure

In the event that classes do not meet because Elizabethtown College is closed or delayed due to inclement weather or some other emergency, the slides that would have been covered during the missed classes will be posted through Canvas.  Students are expected to do the assigned reading, review the slides, and e-mail the instructor with any questions. There will also be an opportunity to ask questions about the material when classes resume.

If a scheduled exam or lab is missed, it will normally be made up on the day that classes resume.  If the College is closed on a day when a project is due, the project due date will also normally be extended until the day when classes resume.  If circumstances render either of these makeup policies unreasonable, the instructor will send an e-mail explaining an alternative makeup opportunity to each studentâ€™s Elizabethtown e-mail account.

## Diversity and Inclusivity Statement

I consider this classroom to be a place where you will be treated with respect, and I welcome individuals of all ages, backgrounds, beliefs, ethnicities, genders, gender identities, gender expressions, national origins, religious affiliations, sexual orientations, ability - and other visible and non-visible differences. All members of this class are expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming and inclusive environment for every other member of the class.
