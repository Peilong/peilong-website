## Course Coverage

This course is a directed project or study requiring faculty acceptance of a proposal with a final report and defense of work. It is intended as an advanced research course for Data Science.

Under the supervision of a faculty mentor, students use their knowledge of data science to complete a high level project contributing to research in an academic area or to solve a problem for a local business. Projects will involve data collection, data cleaning, data analysis, and reporting results both orally and in writing to a domain expert or business leader. All problems are unstructured with no predetermined solution.

## Student Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

*	Apply knowledge of data science appropriate to the discipline, including advanced skills like big data parallel processing and neural networks
* Analyze a problem and identify and define the data analytical requirements and procedure appropriate to its solution
* Design and implement a computer-based system, process, component or program, to address an open data problem (including open data competitions hosted on Kaggle)
* Communicate effectively with a broad range of audiences
* Engage in continuing professional development
