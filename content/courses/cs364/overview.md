## Course Coverage

Network Security is a comprehensive hands-on course designed for IT professionals, network administrators, and anyone interested in enhancing their network security skills. Covering a broad spectrum of topics, from the basics of networking and TCP protocols to advanced topics such as firewall implementation and security, virtual private networks, and DNS attacks and protection, this course equips students with the knowledge and skills required to defend against network threats. Students will complete a project, present it to their peers, and participate in 'Capture the Flag' competitions to test their skills in a practical, hands-on environment.

## Student Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

* **Foundational Understanding**: Grasp networking security fundamentals, including the protocol layers, packet sniffing and spoofing, and the use of tools such as Scapy and Wireshark.
* **Red and Blue Teaming**: Identify and simulate network threats in each protocol layer as a Red Team, and develop defense strategies as a Blue Team.
* **Practical Application**: Implement high-level security applications, from firewall setups to VPN configurations, to shield networks from vulnerabilities.
* **Collaborative Learning**: Present a network security project, applying course knowledge and receiving peer feedback.
* **Competitive Skill Assessment**: Participate in 'Capture the Flag' competitions, applying knowledge to identify and defend network vulnerabilities.
