## Anaconda Individual Edition

In this course the only software you will need to install and play with is the Anaconda Individual Edition. It is a popular data science platform that consists of almost all the packages you will ever need in Python and R. Find the download link for your system from here: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual. You must download the Python 3.x version. 

**Note:**

Anaconda is also available on the computers in the Esbenshade 281, Hoover 108 and Nicarry 208 computer laboratories and in the Computer Science commons area (E284).
