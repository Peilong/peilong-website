## Visual Studio Code
Downlaod VS Code from this [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and install the Java extension. Follow the instructions posted on Canvas as "Java JDK and VSCode Installation Guide". 

## Java Development Kit (JDK)
JDK comes with different vairations provided by different vendors. Some popular ones are OpenJDK, Oracle Java SE, Amazon Corretto, etc. I recommend installing Adoptium's Temurin via VS Code -- it's so much easier for beginners. The tutorial can be found on the instructions posted on Canvas as "Java JDK and VSCode Installation Guide".  


**Note:**

All the software and operating systems are available on the computers in the Esbenshade 281, Hoover 108 and Nicarry 208 computer laboratories and in the Computer Science commons area (E284).
