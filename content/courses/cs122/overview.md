By the end of the course, students will be able to:

* Learn and understand object oriented programming concepts;
* Be able to use existing objects from a library or API;
* Be able to design and create new objects and to extend existing objects using inheritance;
* To be able to design and create new user interfaces using a GUI;
* Understand and be able to program standard sequential file operations;
* To understand error and exception conditions and be able to implement exception handling;
* Understand the basic concepts of multi-processing using threads and be able to implement multi-threaded programs;
