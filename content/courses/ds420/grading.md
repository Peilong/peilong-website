## Grading Weights

The final grade for this course depends upon the grades and scores earned on course components weighted as follows:

*	**30%**: 6 equally weighted in-class labs - 5% for each lab.
*	**20%**: 5 equally weighted homework assignments – 4% for each assignment.
*	**25%**: 2 midterm exams - 10% for lower grade, and 15% for higher grade.
* **5%** : Pop quizzes.
*	**5%** : Paper Presentation - peer evaluation (50%), instructor evaluation (50%).
*	**15%**: Final Project - project proposal (10%). Midterm check (10%). Project demonstration and presentation (40%). Final project report and revised code (40%).

Grades will be computed by rounding numerical percentages to the nearest integer and applying the following table:

| Letter| Range| Letter | Range | Letter | Range|
|----|--------|----|-------|----|-------|
| A  | 93-100 | B- | 80-82 | D+ | 67-69 |
| A- | 90-92  | C+ | 77-79 | D  | 63-66 |
| B+ | 87-89  | C  | 73-76 | D- | 60-62 |
| B  | 83-86  | C- | 70-72 | F  | 0-59  |


```Grades for each assignment, lab, exam and project will be recorded in Canvas (https://etown.instructure.com/). Note that Canvas does not offer accurate calculation of your final weighted grade (e.g. the two midterm exams do not weigh equally), so students must compute their average by using the Canvas scores with the weights listed above.
```

## Homework Assignments

All homework assignments have to be completed individually in this course. Each assignment must be uploaded into Canvas (https://etown.instructure.com/).  Assignments must *NOT* be stored in a public folder. All submissions must follow the provided file name requirements or risk a score of 0.  
Typically, you will have about two weeks to complete each assignment. All assignments will be graded based on the following criteria:

* Correctness: Finding the right answer
* Formatting:	Displaying the right answer according to instructions
* Style and Documentation: Producing readable code with appropriate comments

Late assignment will lose ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdpi%7B150%7D%20%5Cfn_phv%20%5Clarge%202%5E%7B%28n-1%29%7D) points per day, including weekends and holidays. For example, -1 after 1 day, -2 after 2 days, -4 after 3 days … until 8+ days students will receive 0 score.  Under no circumstances should any student disclose their code, or copy the code written by other students or from an outside source. Both students will receive 0 score on the disclosed/copied assignment.

## In-class labs

All labs are to be done individually, in class, with the assistance of the instructor. Each assignment will be given near the beginning of a class and must be uploaded to Canvas (https://etown.instructure.com/) `before the end of the class without late penalty`. `Extended submission is due on the same day before midnight, but any submission during this grace period will receive 15 points (out of 100) of late penalty`. Submissions beyond midnight the same day will not be accepted. To receive full credit, the source code must be well commented and executed without errors, but partial credit will be considered by the instructor based on the understanding of the material demonstrated by the student’s code.

## Technical Paper Presentation

Presenting data analysis results to public is one of the highly demanded skills from data science employers. As part of the final grade of this course, students are required to read one to two technical papers from the provided paper list (or other papers agreed by the instructor), and present the paper during the last week of class. The grading of the paper presentation consists of 50% from peers and 50% from the instructor. The evaluation rubrics will be provided via Canvas.

## Final Project

The final project best demonstrates students’ understanding of the lecture contents and their capability of solving data science problems as a team or individually. The topic of the final project is left open for the students to solicitate, but the final choice has to be decided upon the instructor’s agreement.
Students are allowed to form a team of no more than 2 people. Teams are responsible for finding the project of their interest and discussing the project feasibility face-to-face with the project manager, a.k.a., the instructor 1 week before the proposal is due. Since the teams have to work on different project topics, the finalization of the project title is on a rolling basis – meaning formerly finalized projects cannot be taken again by another team. The deliverable of the final project contains four major components:

*	10%: the project proposal: must be approved by the instructor
*	10%: midterm check: must have finished essential literature search and data cleaning at this point
*	40%: the project verbal and visual demonstration in class: code and slides must be uploaded the day before the presentation day
*	40%: the project report: due on Wed of the Final Exam week. Must be completed and have included the instructor's improvement suggestions in the final version.

The requirements and grading rubric for each component of the project will be posted on Canvas. Under no circumstances should any student copy the code from an outside source. Source code similarity tools will be used to detect plagiarism.
