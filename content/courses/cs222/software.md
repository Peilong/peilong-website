## Google Cloud Platform
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is the main development environment we will be using in this course. Refer to the guide on Canvas for setup. [link](https://etown.instructure.com/courses/16713/files/3017034?module_item_id=793891). 

Once the setup is ready, you will have:
* A virtual machine running with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* A lightweight desktop GUI that allows for remote desktop connection
* GNU C development toolset: GCC compiler, GDB debugger, make utility, etc. 
* Docker engine. 
* Visual Studio Code IDE, and other desktop applications.
