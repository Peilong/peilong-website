You need an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that contains a GCC compiler, and a machine that runs Ubuntu Linux system in this course.

There are many IDEs you can choose, e.g., Eclipse, Code::Blocks, Visual Studio, and CLion, etc, but for the purpose of in-class demonstration, I will stick with Visual Studio on Windows and Xcode on MacOS.

## For Windows Users

* **IDE**: Visual Studio 2017 (community) and up: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/
* **Ubuntu**: 1) Windows and Ubuntu 16.04 (or newer) dual-boot systems; OR 2) running Ubuntu on a virtual machine (e.g. virtualbox); OR 3) Ubuntu App on Windows 10.


## For MacOS X Users
* **IDE**: Xcode - download from App Store. Make sure you have the Xcode Command Line tools installed. http://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/

## For Linux Users
* You already have the whole world.

**Note:**

All the software and operating systems are available on the computers in the Esbenshade 281, Hoover 108 and Nicarry 208 computer laboratories and in the Computer Science commons area (E284).
