## Course Coverage

This course covers advanced programming and machine representation of data and data structures, including dynamic structures and files. Topics include C language syntax, memory allocation, run-time data organization, function linkage and parameter passing, and the relationship between high-level and machine languages. C is the primary language of instruction with Java being a comparative language. Linux operating system and command line skills will be introduced throughout the course.

## Student Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

* Apply knowledge of computing and mathematics appropriate to the discipline, including common data structures and basic algorithms, to solve problems
* Analyze a problem and identify and define the computing requirements appropriate to its solution
* Design, implement, and evaluate a computer-based system, process, component or program, including operating systems, to meet desired needs
* Function effectively on teams and use software engineering principles to accomplish a common goal
* Understand fundamentals of procedural programming with applications in electrical and computer engineering and embedded systems
* Understand hardware and software elements of data communications and computer networking
* Compare and contrast the features of the Java and C programming languages
* Manage memory allocation explicitly
* Perform low-level file access in programs
