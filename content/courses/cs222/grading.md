## Grading Weights

The final grade for this course depends upon the grades and scores earned on course components weighted as follows:

*	**26%**: 3 projects -- Project 1 and 2 are both 8%, and Project 3 is 10%.
*	**24%**: 8 equally weighted in-class labs – 3% for each lab.
* **25%**: 2 midterm exams: 10% for lower grade, and 15% for higher grade.
*	**5%**: Persistence. Pop quizzes, attendance and in-class question answering.
*	**15%**: Final exam.

Grades will be computed by rounding numerical percentages to the nearest integer and applying the following table:

| A  | 93-100 | B- | 80-82 | D+ | 67-69 |
|----|--------|----|-------|----|-------|
| A- | 90-92  | C+ | 77-79 | D  | 63-66 |
| B+ | 87-89  | C  | 73-76 | D- | 60-62 |
| B  | 83-86  | C- | 70-72 | F  | 0-59  |

```Note that Canvas does not offer accurate calculation of your final weighted grade (e.g. the two midterm exams do not weigh equally), so students must compute their average by using the Canvas scores with the weights listed above.
```

## Projects

All projects have to be completed individually in this course.  Each project must be uploaded into Canvas (https://etown.instructure.com/).  Projects must *NOT* be stored in a public folder.  All submissions must follow the provided file name requirements or risk a score of 0.  
Typically, you will have about three weeks to complete each project. **If the project does not compile, the student will only receive a maximum score of 40.**

All assignments will be graded based on the following criteria:

* Correctness: Finding the right answer
* Formatting:	Displaying the right answer according to instructions
* Style and Documentation: Producing readable code with appropriate comments

Late assignment will lose 2^(n-1) points per day, including weekends and holidays. For example, -1 after 1 day, -2 after 2 days, -4 after 3 days … until 8+ days students will receive 0 score.  Under no circumstances should any student disclose their code, or copy the code written by other students or from an outside source. Both students will receive 0 score on the disclosed/copied assignment.

## In-class Labs

All labs are to be done individually, in class, with the assistance of the instructor. Each assignment will be given near the beginning of a class and must be uploaded to Canvas (https://etown.instructure.com/) before the end of the class. Exercises submitted after class is over will not be accepted. To receive full credit, a programming assignment must compile, but partial credit will be awarded based on the understanding of the material demonstrated by the student’s code.
