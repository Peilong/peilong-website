## Grading Weights

The final grade for this course depends upon the grades and scores earned on course components weighted as follows:

* **4%** : A number of in-class pop quizzes.
* **15%**: Bi-daily reading assignments.
* **16%**: 4 individual homework.
*	**15%**: 3 team projects.
*	**15%**: 5 in-class labs.
* **20%**: 2 midterm exams.
*	**15%**: Final exam or project.

Grades will be computed by rounding numerical percentages to the nearest integer and applying the following table:

| Letter| Range| Letter | Range | Letter | Range|
|----|--------|----|-------|----|-------|
| A  | 93-100 | B- | 80-82 | D+ | 67-69 |
| A- | 90-92  | C+ | 77-79 | D  | 63-66 |
| B+ | 87-89  | C  | 73-76 | D- | 60-62 |
| B  | 83-86  | C- | 70-72 | F  | 0-59  |

```Note that Canvas does not offer accurate calculation of your final weighted grade (e.g. the two midterm exams do not weigh equally), so students must compute their average by using the Canvas scores with the weights listed above.
```

## In-class Labs

All labs are to be done individually, in class, with the assistance of the instructor. 
Each assignment will be given near the beginning of a class and must be uploaded to Canvas before the due time. Some of the labs allow for late submission till midnight with late penalty, but no submission is allowed beyond the lab day. To receive full credit, a programming assignment must compile, but partial credit will be awarded based on the understanding of the material demonstrated by the student’s code.

## Individual Homework and Team Projects

All homework assignments have to be completed individually in this course. Homework assignments are "lab-like" small programs that need to be completed in a week or two. 

All projects are team projects in this course. For each project, students must form a team of 2 members. Teams are responsible for dividing their workload and meeting offline for at least 2 times for each project. Documented meeting minutes have to be submitted as part of the deliverable. Students should select their teams by using the Groups tab under People, on the Canvas webpage.

Except under extreme circumstances, all members of the team will receive the same grade for each project. One member of each team is designated the leader. The files for each project should be zipped up and uploaded by the team leader using Canvas before the due date. **If the project does not compile, the student will receive a score of 0.**

**Late Policy**

In general, homework and projects will be graded with the *diff* utility. For that reason, it is imperative that project output matches sample output to the character.

Late assignment will lose ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdpi%7B150%7D%20%5Cfn_phv%20%5Clarge%202%5E%7B%28n-1%29%7D) points per day, including weekends and holidays. For example, -1 after 1 day, -2 after 2 days, -4 after 3 days … until 8+ days students will receive 0 score.  **Under no circumstances should any student disclose their code, or copy the code written by other students or from an outside source. Both students will receive 0 score on the disclosed/copied assignment.**
